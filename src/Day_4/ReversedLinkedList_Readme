Reversed Linked List
You are given a linked list that contains N integers. You have performed the following reverse operation on the list:
•	Select all the subparts of the list that contain only even integers. For example, if the list is {1,2,8,9,12,16}, then the selected subparts will be {2,8}, {12,16}.
•	Reverse the selected subpart such as {8,2} and {16,12}.
Now, you are required to retrieve the original list.
Note: You should use the following definition of the linked list for this problem:
class Node {
    Object data;
    Node next;
}
Input format
•	First line: N
•	Next line: N space-separated integers that denote elements of the reverse list
Output format
Print the N elements of the original list.

Constraints
1≤N≤103
1≤Ai≤109
Sample Input
9
2 18 24 3 5 7 9 6 12
Sample Output
24 18 2 3 5 7 9 12 6
Explanation
In the sample, the original list is {24,18,2,3,5,7,9,12,6} which when reversed according to the operations will result in the list given in the sample input.
Note: Your code should be able to convert the sample input into the sample output. However, this is not enough to pass the challenge, because the code will be run on multiple test cases. Therefore, your code must solve this problem statement.
